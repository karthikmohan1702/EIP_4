EIP_4 Phase 1 course 


1) Convolution  - is process, to extract important features from the image by overlaying different filters on top of it.
2) Filters/Kernels - filters like blur,edge,emboss..etc are used to extract or filter those features from the input image.
3) Epochs - 1 epoch is whole dataset forward propagated in batches, loss function calculated & errors backpropagated, gradient descent to adjust weights.
4) 1x1 convolution - its a kernel size of 1x 1, used to reduce the number of filters.
5) 3x3 convolution - its a kernel size of 3x 3, a filter which is multiplied & used to extract features from the image.
6) Feature maps - diff filters extract diff features in an img and stored in as feature maps.
7) Activation function - used to capture the non-linearity in data. (eg- sigmoid activation for logistic regression )
8) Receptive field - its how many pixels that we are seeing in the original image.
